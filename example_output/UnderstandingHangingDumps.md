# UnderstandingHangingDumps.MD

This document describes the output format of the `godump` tool, particularly for analyzing hanging goroutines. This tool provides a snapshot of active goroutines, stack traces, and any identified goroutines suspected of hanging.

## Structure of `godump` Output

The `godump` output is structured in multiple sections, each offering specific information about the running goroutines, including any detected hangs.

### 1. **Header Information**

The `godump` output starts with a header:
   - `Time`: Provides a timestamp for when the dump was taken. This timestamp is formatted in `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS`, following the ISO 8601 format.

### 2. **Stack Trace**

The `Stack Trace` section details the exact point in the code where each running goroutine is, including the functions in the call stack. This information is presented in the following structure:

   - `goroutine [ID] [status]`: Indicates the unique identifier and current status (e.g., `running`, `waiting`, or `sleeping`) of the goroutine.
   - Each line in the stack trace:
     - Shows the function call and the memory address offset for each entry in the call stack.
     - Also lists the file path and line number where each function is called.
   - Example:
     ```
     github.com/ghhwer/godump.TakeGoroutineDump(0xc00007e4b0, {0xc00015c008, 0x4, 0xc1c1f9ce55b628d6?})
         /home/ghhwer/project-quack/godump/godump.go:86 +0x2dc
     ```

### 3. **Goroutines Section**

The `Goroutines` section summarizes all currently active goroutines, listing their stack traces and status:

   - `Number of Goroutines`: Total count of goroutines running at the time of the dump.
   - Each goroutine stack trace is listed, including:
     - The entry point and each function call in the stack with relevant memory offsets.
     - Function call locations, showing both file paths and line numbers.

### 4. **Hanging Goroutines Detected** (Unique to `godump`)

The `Hanging Goroutines Detected` section is a `godump`-specific addition that identifies goroutines potentially stuck in long-running or blocking operations. It includes:

   - `Number of Hanging Goroutines`: Total count of goroutines identified as potentially hanging.
   - `Considered Hanging time (ms)`: Threshold time in milliseconds used to determine if a goroutine is considered "hanging." In this example, itâ€™s 10,000 ms (10 seconds).
   - For each hanging goroutine:
     - `Last Change`: The timestamp of the last activity in the goroutine.
     - `Last Mesure`: The timestamp of the measurement (in ISO 8601 format).
     - `Stack`: A list of hexadecimal stack frame addresses associated with the goroutine's current state. These addresses indicate function calls and code locations, useful for debugging the exact state of the hanging process.

Example of a hanging goroutine entry:
```
 * Last Change: 2024-11-03T12:42:33 * Last Mesure: 2024-11-03T12:42:43 (Stack) -> [0x42f911,0x430365,0x430351,0x5714a5,0x476561,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0]
```

Each stack trace of a hanging goroutine shows the address of functions involved in the goroutine's current process, allowing engineers to identify code locations that might be causing the hang.
